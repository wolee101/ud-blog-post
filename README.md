**Project Title**

SF Airbnb Data Analyses -  Udacity Blog Post Project 


## 
**Description**

According to statistics available on Google, there are 150 million Airbnb users that can choose from 1.9 million listings in 65,000 cities around the world at any given time. I myself have tried to use Airbnb once but the host ended up cancelling the day I was checking in because the place had not yet been cleaned. It was an extremely unpleasant experience but I decided not to post a negative review. However, this made me become curious about the characteristics of properties and their hosts, as well as the validity of reviews. I also became interested in finding out how many negative reviews were actually posted.

Because I live in the Bay area I chose to look at San Francisco to find the answers to my questions. The city does not represent all Airbnb listings nor reviews. This is just a project meant to satisfy my curiosity and to conduct some analysis on one of the most visited cities in the United States.

 

Below are my research questions I tried to answer using data from Airbnb listings and reviews in San Francisco.

**Research Questions:**



1. What are the characteristics of Airbnb listings in San Francisco?
2. What are the differences between listings owned by superhosts and non-superhosts?
3. What is the average review score?** **What percentage of reviews are positive or negative?
4. Are there any gender differences in review writing behavior?
5. What are the most common words people say in their reviews?

**Dataset used:**

San Francisco Airbnb listings and reviews data compiled on 8/6/2019 (available at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

**Analyses used:**

Descriptive, regression, classification, and text analyses
